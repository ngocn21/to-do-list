# to-do-list
code that makes, edits, views, and allows user to complete a to-do list

#project decsription
This code allows for a user to add items to a to-do list. It then formulates their list of items and the user now has the option to view their list, add to it, mark something as completed, take something off, clear their entire list, sort it in alphabetical order, see how many items they have in their list, or just quit the program altogether. 
I used a python list code to code this list because python is the only code I learned and it forms a list conveniently and efficiently.
Some challenges I faced was how to give a coded response based on what the user inputed. For example, it was not difficult to code the printing of the list but it was difficult to sort the list in alphabetical order or to mark something as completed.

2. It will continuosly ask you if you would like to continue using the program in which you can respond 'yes' or 'no'.
3. If you say 'yes', it will offer you 8 options (with description of each) to choose from.
4. If you say 'no' the program will quit.
5. You can continue with the program for as long as you would like and you will also always have the option to quit the program whenever you would like.
